# counter_project

A new Flutter project showcasing the use of Bloc architecture.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that goes beyond the basics, emphasizing the use of the Bloc architecture.

If this is your first Flutter project, you might find these resources helpful:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For a deeper understanding of Flutter development and Bloc architecture, consider exploring the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which provides tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## About Bloc Architecture

This application deviates from a typical Flutter project as it is designed and implemented using the Bloc (Business Logic Component) architecture. Bloc architecture is a state management pattern that helps organize and manage the state of your application in a clean and scalable way.

To learn more about Bloc architecture and how it's implemented in Flutter, check out the official documentation: [Bloc Library](https://bloclibrary.dev/).

Understanding Bloc architecture is crucial for building scalable and maintainable Flutter applications. Feel free to explore the project's code to see how Bloc is integrated and utilized in this application.

Happy coding!
